They say yabba-dabba-doo
Now they say yabba-dabba-who?
They say yabba-dabba-doo
Now they say yabba-dabba-who?
All that's left of you is them gummies, yeah
All that's left of you is them gummies

They left you like a fossil in the dust
You used your feet to drive, there was no technology

And all three children made it
I'm proud of you, Fred, I'm proud of you, Fred
Did Barney do just as well?
I hope he did, I hope he did
Can we carbon-date your bones?
Freddie, Fred, Fred Flintstone
